armsflow
========

A Java/Processing visualization of international arms trades tracked by SIPRI, with a Ruby on Rails backend

This project was written in 2007 and I probably wouldn't have written it this way today. Still, it's interesting and valuable information in an interactive visual browsing interface.

* arcflow/ - a Processing app which draws arcs on a world map
* arcflow_home/ - a larger version of arcflow which renders on the index page of ARMSFLOW.org
* armsflow/ - hmmm... i forget
* flowbase/ - a Ruby on Rails app to serve SIPRI data from a MySQL database to the Processing applets
* scripts/ - scripts to extract data from the SIPRI database
* sipri-export/ - exported data from the SIPRI database
